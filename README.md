# MONAH: Multi-Modal Narratives for Humans

## Problem

Analyzing videos in video format (visual + audio + text) needs a lot of human expertise and end-to-end deep learning
methods are less interpretable.

## Solution

Inspired by how the linguistics community analyze conversations using the Jefferson transcription system. MONAH creates
a multi-modal text narrative for dyadic (two-people) video-recorded conversations by weaving _what_ is being said with
_how_ its being said.

# ScreenCast

# Required Inputs

Two videos, one for each speaker. Works best when the camera is in front of the speaker, instead of from an angle.
Verbatim Transcript from Google Cloud Speech to Text.

# User Interface

Text menu based for easy configuration.
